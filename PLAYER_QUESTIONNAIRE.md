# Character Creation Questionnaire

## The Concept

You're part of a group of friends in Lakeshire who regularly hang out at the local inn. You all have normal day jobs (blacksmith, priest, innkeeper, etc.), but you've helped each other through some dangerous situations before. You're drinking buddies who trust each other.

Think of it like: **The pub regulars who accidentally became heroes.**

**No D&D knowledge needed!** Just answer these questions based on what sounds fun to you. We'll build your character from your answers.
