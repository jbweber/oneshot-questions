## Quick Tips for WoW Players

- **No Auto-attacks:** In D&D, you choose your action each turn. There's no standing still auto-attacking!
- **No Talent Trees:** Your big choices are at character creation and certain levels (subclass at level 3 usually)
- **Spell Slots:** Casters use spell slots instead of mana - you get them back after a long rest
- **Hit Dice:** Like eating food in WoW, but you roll dice during short rests to heal
- **Advantage/Disadvantage:** Like crit chance - roll two d20s and take the higher/lower
- **Action Economy:** You typically get one action, one bonus action, and movement per turn
- **Party composition is flexible:** Unlike WoW raids requiring specific roles, D&D groups can succeed with creative combinations

---

## Multiclassing Option

D&D lets you take levels in multiple classes! Want a Paladin/Warlock (Retribution Paladin with fel magic)? A Fighter/Rogue (Combat rogue with weapon specialization)? You can do it! Ask your DM about multiclassing rules.

---

**Remember:** D&D is more flexible than WoW. Work with your DM to capture the exact fantasy you want. These are just starting points!
